# Deploy static website to cloud

There are several services that can host static website. From my point of view, these approaches fall into three categories:

- Storage services (hosting is storing)
- Compute services (static files resides on a virtual machine, which are served via a web server)
- Container services (the static website is packaged into a container)

In this repository, I will write guides on how to deploy static website to some notable services of popular cloud providers (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform).
