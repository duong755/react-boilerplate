# Deploy static website to Amazon Web Services

I have chosen some services of AWS to deploy static website to, including:
- Amazon S3
- Amazon Lightsail
- Amazon ECS

Of course, there are other services that can help but I don't write about them here:
- Amazon Amplify
- Amazon Elastic Beanstalk
- Amazon EC2
- Amazon EKS
- Amazon Fargate
